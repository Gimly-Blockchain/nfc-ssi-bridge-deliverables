# Envisioned interoperability
The SSI-NFC Bridge has numerous applications within the eSSIF-lab  ecosystem.

We are speaking with several projects to create lasting interoperability.

## Presentations Exchange - Sphereon
Allowing the NFC cards to participate in the presentation exchange brings high security and privacy to data consent exchanges.  We plan to build a plug-in to their library enabling the use of NFC  cards in the exchange.

## Automated data agreements - iGrant
Similar to the presentations Exchange,  we plan to extend their functionality to allow the use of NFC devices in secure and private credentials exchange.

## Open up - Evernym
We plan to build a plug-in to the Mobile SDK and integration in Connect Me To allow users to use NFC cards as cold wallets, bringing superior security and privacy.
/*
* This sounds a bit like we will be building a separate plugin for the evernym mobile SDK?
* Ideally the bridge will work in itself with the evernym wallet as well.
* Creating a separate plugin might be something out of scope but worth exploring for sure.

## Wordpress plugin - Associazone Blockchain Italia
We want to allow WordPress login with the secure NFC device,  or allow 2FA login with NFC device. Using the card for 2FA login will bring very high security to identity accounts.

## Wallet providers
By integrating our library into any of the wallet providers, the wallet gets an immediate easy to use and highly secure cold wallet.  this can be done in the following projects:
1. Letstrust.org SSI wallet - SSI Fabric
2. e-Origin wallet - eorigin.eu
3. GAYA SSI wallet - NYM lab
4. SSI4DTM - Joinyourbit
5. SCEP SDK - Domi Labs
6. Dynamic Data Sharing Hub wallet - The Human Colossus Foundation

/*
* I discussed Off-blocks intergation with Sphereon, but this is for now not feasible for Sphereon.
* Should we add here that this will require work on these projects parts as well to integrate the bridge?
